Project Explanation: Email/SMS Spam Classifier
Project Overview
This project is an Email/SMS Spam Classifier application that uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to predict if a message is "Spam" or "Not Spam". The core of the project is built in Python and includes a web interface developed with Streamlit, allowing users to input a message and get immediate classification results. The machine learning model is trained using labeled data and applies the TF-IDF vectorization technique for effective text analysis.

Project Components
1. requirements.txt
This file lists the dependencies required to run the project, including:

numpy, pandas for data manipulation.
nltk for text preprocessing.
scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
xgboost (optional, if exploring alternative models).
2. downloadnltk.py
This script downloads necessary resources from NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to handle text data, such as tokenizers and stopwords. It ensures these resources are available for text preprocessing:
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('punkt_tab')
3. preprocess.py
The preprocess.py file handles data loading, preprocessing, and preparing the data for model training. Main tasks include:

Data Loading: Loads the spam.csv dataset, a collection of labeled spam and ham messages.
Data Cleaning: Removes unnecessary columns and duplicates.
Text Transformation: A custom function, transform_text, converts text to lowercase, tokenizes, removes stopwords, and applies stemming to reduce words to their base forms.
Vectorization: Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical data suitable for model training.
Saving Preprocessed Data: Saves processed data arrays and the TF-IDF vectorizer as .npy and .pkl files respectively for easy access.
4. trainmodel.py
This file is responsible for training and saving the machine learning model. It uses a MultinomialNB classifier from scikit-learn, evaluating its performance on test data.

Model Training: Loads processed data and trains the model.
Evaluation: Calculates model accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision score to measure performance.
Model Saving: Saves the trained model as model.pkl for later use in prediction.
5. app.py
The main Streamlit application file where users interact with the model. It provides a simple, user-friendly interface for text classification.

Input Processing: Users enter a message, which is preprocessed and classified.
Model Prediction: Based on the trained model's output, the message is classified as either "Spam" or "Not Spam."
Result Display: Shows results with clear labels and conditional formatting to enhance user experience.
Project Execution
To set up and run the project:

Install Dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install necessary libraries.
Download NLTK Data: Execute downloadnltk.py to get required NLTK resources.
Data Preprocessing and Training: Use preprocess.py and trainmodel.py to prepare data and train the model.
Run Application: Launch app.py using streamlit run app.py to access the web app and classify messages.
